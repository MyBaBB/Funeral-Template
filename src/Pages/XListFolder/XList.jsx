In light of recent inheritance disputes and deeply distressing accusations of elder abuse made by certain family members, I have made the difficult decision to remove the funeral photos of Mrs. Elsa Rodriguez from this website. <span>These claims are false</span> and they have fractured our family and undermined the clear intentions expressed in her will. While two siblings (not three) continue to contest her final wishes, they have also chosen to spread misinformation that misrepresents both our family and the truth.

<p>
I believe the truth will come to light, and that Mrs. Rodriguez—who was a kind, gracious, and deeply respectful woman—would never have wanted her primary caregivers to be vilified for selfish reasons. Out of respect for her legacy and the integrity of this platform, I have refrained from naming anyone directly. This website is my creation, my property, my copyright under my license. I reserve the right to curate its content and to defend myself against falsehoods and public mis-characterizations.

You are welcome to read this message or not. But I felt it necessary to explain why those images—once a tribute to unity and remembrance—are no longer publicly displayed. I also reserve the right to speak openly about the greed and dishonesty that have surfaced in this painful chapter of our family`s history.

      <p className='text-gray-300'> Image Update Notice: </p>
       
 <p>
Once I`ve completed processing the images and respectfully removing certain individuals from my database, I will re-post the funeral photos of Mrs. Elsa Rodriguez. These images were meant to honor her life and legacy—not to be clouded by the recent wave of negativity and falsehoods stirred by her own flesh and blood. By restoring these photos without the surrounding energy of conflict, I hope to reclaim the spirit of remembrance and respect that Mrs. Rodriguez truly deserved.
